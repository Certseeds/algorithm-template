# lab_05_C â€” Bracket Matching

## Description

LowbieH is learning about matching brackets in the classroom.

There are n brackets, and LowbieH wants to know whether they are matched.

The brackets will only contain `{, }, (, ), [, ]`.

Here is the matching rules.

For example, `{(}{[]})` is not matched, but `([{{}}()])` is matched.

Please write a program to check whether the given string is matched or not.

## Input

The first line will be an integer `T (1 <= T <= 10)`, which is the number of test cases.

For each test case, the first line will be an integer `n(1 <= n <= 30000)`.

Then there is a line with `n` brackets.

## Output

For each test case, print YES if the test case is a matched case.

Otherwise, print NO.

## Sample Input

```log
7
1
(
2
()
2
{]
6
[(){}]
4
(])[
8
[[{{}}]]
6
][{]]
```

## Sample Output

```log
NO
YES
NO
YES
NO
YES
NO
```
