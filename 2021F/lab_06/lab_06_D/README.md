# lab_06_D â€” Rotation Check

## Description

Given two strings `S,T`, you are required to judge if you can obtain one of the two strings by rotating the other one.

## Input

Two lines, indicating two strings `S,T  ( 1 <= |S|,|T| <= 10^6 )`

## Output

One line, "Yes" (without quotes) if you can obtain one of the two strings by rotating the other one, "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

## Sample Input

```log
abcde cdeab
```

## Sample Output

```log
Yes
```

## HINT

`(abcde)` and `(cdeab)` -> Yes
`(abcde)` and `(edcba)` -> No
`(abcdeabcde)` and `(abcde)` -> No

Example of rotating a string:

`( abcde)` -> `(bcdea)` -> `( cdeab)` -> `(deabc)` -> `(eabcd)` -> `( abcde)`
