# lab_06_E â€” Longest Palindromic Substring

## Description

Given a string `S`, you are required to find the length of its longest palindromic substring.

Here we define a string is palindromic if and only if you can get the exactly same string by reversing the original string.

For example, string `abcba` is palindromic while `abcab` is not.

## Input

One line containing `S  (1<= |S| <= 10^5)`

## Output

One integer, indicating the answer

## Sample Input

```log
abcbad
```

## Sample Output
